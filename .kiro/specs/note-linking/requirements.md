# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The note linking feature allows users to create and navigate between linked notes using a Markdown-style syntax. This feature enhances the application's ability to connect related ideas, implementing a core concept from Vannevar Bush's Memex vision.

## Requirements

2. WHEN selecting a note from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL insert a properly formatted link `[text](note:note_id)` at the cursor position
3. WHEN viewing a note with links THEN the system SHALL render links as clickable text
4. WHEN clicking on a link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the linked note

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a note-taker, I want the link creation process to be intuitive and non-disruptive, so that I can maintain my flow while writing.
