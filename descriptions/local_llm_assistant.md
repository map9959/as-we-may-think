# Local LLM Assistant

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a local Language Model (LLM) assistant for the As We May Think project. The assistant will run entirely on the user's machine, using a small language model optimized for CPU usage, allowing users to query their notes and receive AI-assisted insights without requiring an internet connection or sending data to external services.

## Requirements

- Must run efficiently on CPU hardware
- Minimal memory footprint (ideally <8GB RAM usage)
- Ability to process user queries in natural language
- Integration with the existing note storage system
- Response generation based on user's personal knowledge base
- Privacy-focused (all processing happens locally)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Language Model Selection

We'll use a small, efficient LLM that balances performance with resource requirements:

- **Recommended Models**:
  - [Llama 3 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) - Good balance of size and performance
  - [Phi-3 Mini](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-3-mini) - Extremely efficient for its size
  - [TinyLlama](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0) - Very small footprint
  - [RWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) - RNN with transformer-like capabilities, very CPU efficient

- **Quantization**:
  - Implement 4-bit or 8-bit quantization to reduce memory requirements
  - Use GGUF format for broad compatibility with local inference engines

### 2. Inference Engine Integration

We'll use one of these lightweight inference engines:

- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)** - Highly optimized C++ implementation
- **[ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers)** - Python bindings with good performance
- **[transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js)** - For web implementation if needed

### 3. Backend Integration

Extend the existing Python backend (`backend/main.py`) to:

1. Download and cache the selected LLM on first run
2. Provide an API endpoint for model inference
3. Implement context retrieval from the user's notes database
4. Handle tokenization and prompt construction

### 4. Frontend Implementation

Add to the Flutter application:

1. Create a new AI assistant screen/widget
2. Implement a chat-like interface for queries and responses
3. Add settings for model configuration and behavior
4. Provide feedback on processing status during inference

### 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Implement a simple RAG system to improve the relevance of responses:

1. Create vector embeddings for user notes (using a small embedding model)
2. Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or SQLite with vector extension)
3. Retrieve relevant notes based on semantic similarity to user queries
4. Include retrieved context in prompts to the LLM

## Technical Architecture

```
User Query → 
    Frontend → 
        Backend API → 
            1. Context Retrieval (get relevant notes)
            2. Prompt Construction
            3. Local LLM Inference
            4. Response Processing
        Response to Frontend →
    Display to User
```

## Performance Considerations

- Implement background model loading during application startup
- Cache results of common queries
- Use streaming responses to improve perceived performance
- Provide user settings to balance speed vs. quality (model size options)
